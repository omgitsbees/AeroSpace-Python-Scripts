Launch Schedule Optimization = The idea behind this project is to optimize the scheduling of rocket launches, taking into consideration factors like weather conditions, rocket availability, payload readiness, crew availability, and air traffic.

step-by-step breakdown:
Step 1: Define the Problem

We want to optimize the scheduling of rocket launches. The inputs to the problem might include:

    Launch Windows: Available time slots for launching rockets.
    Rocket Availability: Whether a rocket is ready for launch.
    Payload Readiness: Whether the payload is ready for launch.
    Weather Conditions: Whether the weather is favorable for launch.
    Crew Availability: Whether the crew is available and ready.

Step 2: Define Constraints

Some constraints to consider:

    Rockets cannot be launched outside of their designated launch windows.
    Weather conditions must be favorable for a launch to occur.
    Payload must be ready and loaded.
    Crew must be available and rested.

Step 3: Implement the Optimization

simple optimization technique where we will try to assign the best possible launch windows based on the constraints.

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP): treat this as a CSP where each launch needs to satisfy several constraints (e.g., weather, rocket readiness, payload, etc.).

Optimization Algorithm: use an optimization algorithm like Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find the optimal launch schedule.

Data Structures: use sophisticated data structures like classes to represent rockets, payloads, and schedules.

Concurrency: Introduce concurrency with asyncio to simulate real-time checks and decision-making.

Logging and Error Handling: Add logging and exception handling for robustness.

Visualization: Generate a Gantt chart to visualize the schedule.

Explanation of the Enhanced Code:

    Classes and Data Structures: The Rocket, Payload, Weather, Crew, LaunchWindow, and Schedule are more clearly defined using namedtuples and classes for better data management.

    Constraint Satisfaction and Genetic Algorithm: The code uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization, which is a more sophisticated method than simple loops and checks. The GA simulates a natural selection process to find an optimal solution by generating, mutating, and crossing over schedules.

    Concurrency: asyncio is used to simulate real-time decision-making and to allow the script to handle multiple tasks concurrently, which can be especially useful if the scheduling process needs to be responsive to real-time changes.

    Logging and Error Handling: Logging is implemented to track the progress and decisions made during the optimization process, which adds professionalism to the script and helps in debugging and analysis.

    Visualization: A Gantt chart is generated using matplotlib to visually represent the launch schedule, which is a critical feature for demonstrating the results to stakeholders.

    PyOD: Specialized library for outlier detection.
    Streamlit (Optional): For creating an interactive dashboard/interface.

    Detailed Explanation:
1. Synthetic Data Generation:

Since real aerospace telemetry data may not be publicly available, we generate synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios.

    Features Generated:
        Altitude: Simulated around 10,000 meters with some variance.
        Velocity: Around 250 m/s.
        Acceleration: Centered around 0 m/s¬≤ to represent steady flight with occasional fluctuations.
        Temperature: Around 15¬∞C with variations.
        Pressure: Around 1013 hPa (standard atmospheric pressure).
        Fuel Level: Starting with 5000 liters and varying slightly.

    Anomaly Injection:
        We introduce anomalies by randomly altering the values of these features significantly at random timestamps.
        This simulates scenarios like sudden drops or spikes in readings due to malfunctions or external factors.

2. Data Preprocessing:

    Handling Missing Values: Although our synthetic data doesn't have missing values, this step ensures robustness by forward and backward filling any gaps.
    Scaling: We use StandardScaler to normalize the data, which is crucial for many anomaly detection algorithms to perform effectively.

3. Anomaly Detection Methods:

We implement multiple methods to detect anomalies, each with its strengths:
a. Z-Score Method:

    Concept: Identifies how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.
    Threshold: Typically set at 3, meaning any data point beyond 3 standard deviations is considered an anomaly.

b. Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:

    Concept: Uses the middle 50% of data to identify outliers.
    Threshold: Commonly set at 1.5 times the IQR above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile.

c. Isolation Forest:

    Concept: An ensemble method that isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and splitting value.
    Advantages: Efficient on large datasets and can handle high-dimensional data.
    Parameters:
        Contamination: Proportion of anomalies in the data.

d. One-Class SVM:

    Concept: Learns the boundary of normal data and identifies points outside this boundary as anomalies.
    Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel captures non-linear relationships.
    Parameters:
        Nu: An upper bound on the fraction of training errors and a lower bound of the fraction of support vectors.

e. Autoencoder (Deep Learning):

    Concept: Neural network trained to reconstruct its input. High reconstruction error indicates anomalies.
    Architecture:
        Encoder: Compresses input data.
        Decoder: Reconstructs data from the compressed representation.
    Training:
        Trained on normal data to minimize reconstruction error.
    Detection:
        Reconstruction error is calculated, and a threshold is set to identify anomalies.

4. Visualization:

    For each detection method, we plot the time series of each feature and highlight detected anomalies.
    Plots are saved in the specified directory for review.

5. Reporting:

    Detailed reports are generated in CSV format listing all detected anomalies with their timestamps and feature values.
    These reports are essential for post-analysis and validation.

6. Evaluation:

    We use classification metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of each detection method against the known anomalies.
    This helps in understanding which method performs best under different scenarios.

7. Model Saving:

    Trained models are saved for future use or deployment.
    Models like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM are saved using pickle, while the Autoencoder model is saved in HDF5 format.

8. Modularity and Extensibility:

    The code is organized into functions, making it easy to maintain and extend.
    New detection methods or features can be added seamlessly.

9. Logging:

    Comprehensive logging is implemented to track the execution flow and debug if necessary.
    Logs provide timestamps and detailed messages for each major step.

10. Real-time Processing Capability:

    While the current implementation processes batch data, it can be extended to handle streaming data by adapting the functions to process incoming data points or windows
