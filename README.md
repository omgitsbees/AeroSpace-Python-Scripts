Flight Data Analysis and Reporting = This script will simulate the collection of flight data, perform statistical analysis, and generate a report with visualizations.
The simulate_flight_data() function generates random data for altitude, velocity, and temperature. This mimics real flight data collection. The analyze_flight_data() function calculates basic statistics such as mean, max, and min values for each metric. The generate_report() function creates a PDF report. It includes a summary of the analysis and visualizes the data over time.
