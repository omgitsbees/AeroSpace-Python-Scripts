NASA Dataset.py = This grabs data from a publcily available .csv file from NASA's datasets, titled Outgassing_Db_20240828.csv

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

best_prices_new_glenn.py = this simulates parts, and prices as if they are on the Blue Origin New Glenn rocket, grabbing prices from multiple vendors in order to compare 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cad_parts_list.py = this automation script takes the parts list from a CAD file and creates a csv with the weight, and size dimensions of each part

Flight Data Analysis and Reporting = This script will simulate the collection of flight data, perform statistical analysis, and generate a report with visualizations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simulate_flight_data() function generates random data for altitude, velocity, and temperature. This mimics real flight data collection. The analyze_flight_data() function calculates basic statistics such as mean, max, and min values for each metric. The generate_report() function creates a PDF report. It includes a summary of the analysis and visualizes the data over time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply Chain Optimization = automate the analysis and reporting of vendor performance, parts availability, and cost-effectiveness.

Simulate Data Collection: 'simulate_supply_chain_data() generates random data for vendors, parts, costs, lead times, and quality scores.

Data Analysis: 'analyze_supply_chain_data() calculates mean cost, lead time, and quality score for each vendor.

Optimization: 'optimize_supplier_selection() uses linear programming to minimize the total cost while ensuring each part is supplied and no vendor is overused.

Report Generation: 'generate_report() creates a PDF report with vendor performance summary and the results of the supplier optimization.

Propulsion System Performance Monitoring.py = The goal of this project is to develop a Python script that monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) of a propulsion system, such as thrust, fuel consumption, temperature, and vibration levels, and generates alerts or reports when certain thresholds are exceeded.

Data Ingestion: The script will simulate the ingestion of propulsion system data from various sensors.

Data Processing: It will process the data to calculate performance metrics like efficiency and detect anomalies.

Alerting: The script will generate alerts when performance metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

Reporting: It will generate a summary report of the propulsion system's performance over a specific period.

Simulate Propulsion Data: The simulate_propulsion_data function generates synthetic data for thrust, fuel consumption, temperature, and vibration levels over time.

Analyze Performance: The analyze_performance function computes key performance metrics and detects anomalies using the Z-score method.

Generate Alerts: If any anomalies are detected, an alert is printed to the console with details of the anomalies.

Generate Report: The generate_report function writes a detailed performance report to a text file, including summaries and any detected anomalies.

Visualization: The optional visualization step plots the time series data for better insight into the propulsion system's performance.

Launch Schedule Optimization = The idea behind this project is to optimize the scheduling of rocket launches, taking into consideration factors like weather conditions, rocket availability, payload readiness, crew availability, and air traffic.

step-by-step breakdown:
Step 1: Define the Problem

We want to optimize the scheduling of rocket launches. The inputs to the problem might include:

    Launch Windows: Available time slots for launching rockets.
    Rocket Availability: Whether a rocket is ready for launch.
    Payload Readiness: Whether the payload is ready for launch.
    Weather Conditions: Whether the weather is favorable for launch.
    Crew Availability: Whether the crew is available and ready.

Step 2: Define Constraints

Some constraints to consider:

    Rockets cannot be launched outside of their designated launch windows.
    Weather conditions must be favorable for a launch to occur.
    Payload must be ready and loaded.
    Crew must be available and rested.

Step 3: Implement the Optimization

simple optimization technique where we will try to assign the best possible launch windows based on the constraints.

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP): treat this as a CSP where each launch needs to satisfy several constraints (e.g., weather, rocket readiness, payload, etc.).

Optimization Algorithm: use an optimization algorithm like Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find the optimal launch schedule.

Data Structures: use sophisticated data structures like classes to represent rockets, payloads, and schedules.

Concurrency: Introduce concurrency with asyncio to simulate real-time checks and decision-making.

Logging and Error Handling: Add logging and exception handling for robustness.

Visualization: Generate a Gantt chart to visualize the schedule.

Explanation of the Enhanced Code:

    Classes and Data Structures: The Rocket, Payload, Weather, Crew, LaunchWindow, and Schedule are more clearly defined using namedtuples and classes for better data management.

    Constraint Satisfaction and Genetic Algorithm: The code uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization, which is a more sophisticated method than simple loops and checks. The GA simulates a natural selection process to find an optimal solution by generating, mutating, and crossing over schedules.

    Concurrency: asyncio is used to simulate real-time decision-making and to allow the script to handle multiple tasks concurrently, which can be especially useful if the scheduling process needs to be responsive to real-time changes.

    Logging and Error Handling: Logging is implemented to track the progress and decisions made during the optimization process, which adds professionalism to the script and helps in debugging and analysis.

    Visualization: A Gantt chart is generated using matplotlib to visually represent the launch schedule, which is a critical feature for demonstrating the results to stakeholders.
